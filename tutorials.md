# Tutorial

The following tutorials walk you through performing FDTD simulation using the Dupid library.

There are 4 basic objects in a Dupid Simulation.

* [Simulation](simulation)
  the simulation object
* [DupidSource](dupid_source)
  the source object which creates the electromagnetic waves in the simulation
* [DupidObject](dupid_object)
  the materials with which the electromagnetic waves will interact
* [detector](detector)
  the detector which takes reading during the running of the simulation
